### About the Experiment 

To understand and perform the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique for amplifying a specific segment of DNA, and to explore the principles, components, and thermal cycling steps involved in the process. This experiment aims to demonstrate how PCR can be used to generate millions of copies of a target DNA sequence, which is fundamental in molecular biology applications such as genetic analysis, diagnostics, and research.
